<p>This page is a central repository of all useful information for people helping to create a community-run Kerbal Space Program mod hosting site.</p>

<p>See this forum thread: <a href="http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/71133-Community-Mod-Repository-and-The-Majiir-Challenge">forum thread</a></p>

<p>The thread is getting rather long, so I thought I'd create somewhere we could add information, both for reference, and to get new people up to speed without having ot trawl 20+ forum pages.</p>

<p>Nothing is set in stone yet, so if you have a better place to host this info, feel free to do so. Even betterm, ask me and I can provide you with the source (tables are annoying to copy).</p>

<p>OK, so Majiir noticed a while back that Kerbal Space Port was getting increasingly inadequate for the modding community's needs, so he announced a Challenge for someone to develop a new replacement, which he had the resources to sufficiently host.</p>

<p>What with the recent announcement that <a href="http://kerbaldevteam.tumblr.com/post/84927345579/kerbal-space-program-curse-com-partner-together-for">Curse are taking over mod management</a> and <a href="http://kerbalspaceport.com/">Kerbal Space Port</a> is being closed on the 30th May, interest has spiked in building a new mod hosting platform.</p>

<p>Currently, various efforts are being made by lone coders to build a site, which you can read about on the aforementioned <a href="http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/71133-Community-Mod-Repository-and-The-Majiir-Challenge">forum thread</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>At the moment, <a href="http://www.kerbalstation.org/">this site</a> is the most complete and visible effort (because it was made earlier)</li>
<li>It has been <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/24yufz/a_bit_ago_i_built_kerbal_space_station_a_quick/">donated to the community</a> by its author.</li>
<li>Its github repo is <a href="https://github.com/kerbalspaceprogram">here</a>, and it's written in Ruby on Rails.</li>
</ul><p>I'll make this page editable to interested parties, but in the meantime here's what I've gleaned from the thread.</p>

<p>No commenting, or option to Disable commenting per-mod.</p>

<hr><p>Off-site downloads, but still tracking clicks. Consider that those mods may become 404, require captchas, or otherwise offer poor UX to our users.</p>

<p>Subscription to mod updates. RSS feeds. Push notifications? (There must be a third party service for all of these. Mailchimp integration?)</p>

<hr><p>Do not force quality. Do not force semantics. Do not force required file structures.</p>

<p>Allow different licenses. Possibly require users to click "accept" to donwload, as a mod-specific setting? (I'm not a lawyer)</p>

<p>Flag for spam, offensive, etc. Moderation thing.</p>
