{"name":"Medavox.github.io","tagline":"Kerbal Space Port community replacement, see http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/71133-Community-Mod-Repository-and-The-Majiir-Challenge","body":"# ATTENTION: Page is Moving!\r\nUpdates will now happen over \r\n\r\n[here](https://github.com/monkey100/replaceport/wiki).\r\n\r\n This page is out on its own a bit, and would benefit from more collaboration. So I'm going to throw my lot in with O-Doc's effort.\r\n\r\n\r\n# ReplacePort Info Page\r\n\r\nThis page is a central repository of all useful information for people helping to create a community-run Kerbal Space Program mod hosting site.\r\n\r\nUPDATE: Slight change of purpose: because several people are now writing their own design documents (which are better than anything I would have time to create), this page now **links to useful info, rather than hosts it**. More of a portal than a design document itself.\r\n\r\nSee this forum thread: [forum thread](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/71133-Community-Mod-Repository-and-The-Majiir-Challenge)\r\n\r\n**Nothing is set in stone yet**, so if you have a better idea about something listed here, **please say so**. Or if you know of a better place to host this info, feel free to do so. Ask me and I can provide you with the Markdown or HTML source (tables are annoying to copy).\r\n\r\n##The Story So Far\r\n\r\nMajiir noticed a while back (in february) that Kerbal Space Port was getting increasingly inadequate for the modding community's needs, so he announced a Challenge for someone to develop a new replacement, which he had the resources to sufficiently host.\r\n\r\nWhat with the announcement on May that [Curse are taking over mod management](http://kerbaldevteam.tumblr.com/post/84927345579/kerbal-space-program-curse-com-partner-together-for) and [Kerbal Space Port](http://kerbalspaceport.com/) is being closed on the 30th May, interest has spiked in building a new mod hosting platform.\r\n\r\nCurrently, various parallel efforts are being made to build a site, which you can read about on the aforementioned [forum thread](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/71133-Community-Mod-Repository-and-The-Majiir-Challenge), and on the section titled Known Projects Being Worked On, further down.\r\n\r\n[\"What we lack is a cohesive set of core features. In other words, we haven't yet (in my opinion) established a good starting point.\"](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/71133-Community-Mod-Repository-and-The-Majiir-Challenge?p=1001647&viewfull=1#post1001647) - Majiir\r\n\r\nLet's change that. Let's build a development roadmap, shall we?\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nI'll make this page editable to interested parties, but in the meantime here's what I've gleaned from the thread.\r\n\r\n\r\n##People Who Have Offered to Help\r\n\r\nName | Type of help | Contact details (permission needed)\r\n-----|--------------|------------------------------------\r\nMajiir | Hosting | See first forum post\r\nFEinchinger | creating a site | ''\r\ncroxis | creating a site | ''\r\nrappelle | creating a site, needs crowdsourced design docs | \r\nZeroIgnite | also writing this guide | \r\nmedavox| made this guide :) | [forum account](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/members/74223-medavox)\r\npsyper | [\"I can't see anything here which is outside of my skills set\"](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/71133-Community-Mod-Repository-and-The-Majiir-Challenge?p=1000827&viewfull=1#post1000827) |\r\njohnley | [\"I would love to help with this project\"](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/71133-Community-Mod-Repository-and-The-Majiir-Challenge?p=1005649&viewfull=1#post1005649) | see quote link\r\n\r\n##Resources & Links\r\n* [Forum thread](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/71133-Community-Mod-Repository-and-The-Majiir-Challenge)\r\n* [Design Document](https://onedrive.live.com/view.aspx?resid=131B3D0DB2B5645E!13895&ithint=file%2c.docx&app=Word&authkey=!AI8mdtoB8fHqr8s) made in March by TrueBorn\r\n* [Majiir's Preferences](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/71133-Community-Mod-Repository-and-The-Majiir-Challenge?p=1004462&viewfull=1#post1004462) on technologies used in the server.
