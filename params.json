Even betterm, ask me and I can provide you with the source (tables are annoying to copy).\r\n\r\n##The Story So Far\r\n\r\nOK, so Majiir noticed a while back that Kerbal Space Port was getting increasingly inadequate for the modding community's needs, so he announced a Challenge for someone to develop a new replacement, which he had the resources to sufficiently host.\r\n\r\nWhat with the recent announcement that [Curse are taking over mod management](http://kerbaldevteam.tumblr.com/post/84927345579/kerbal-space-program-curse-com-partner-together-for) and [Kerbal Space Port](http://kerbalspaceport.com/) is being closed on the 30th May, interest has spiked in building a new mod hosting platform.\r\n\r\nCurrently, various efforts are being made by lone coders to build a site, which you can read about on the aforementioned [forum thread](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/71133-Community-Mod-Repository-and-The-Majiir-Challenge).\r\n\r\n* At the moment, [this site](http://www.kerbalstation.org/) is the most complete and visible effort (because it was made earlier)\r\n* It has been [donated to the community](http://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/24yufz/a_bit_ago_i_built_kerbal_space_station_a_quick/) by its author.\r\n* Its github repo is [here](https://github.com/kerbalspaceprogram), and it's written in Ruby on Rails.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI'll make this page editable to interested parties, but in the meantime here's what I've gleaned from the thread.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n##People Who Have Offered to Help\r\n\r\nName | Type of help | Contact details (permission needed)\r\n-----|--------------|------------------------------------\r\nMajiir | Hosting | See first forum post\r\nFEinchinger | creating a site | ''\r\nO Doc | |\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brainstorming Notes Poached From RadGH\r\n\r\nSorry for not asking permission yet.\r\n\r\n\r\n* Prominent Download link, above-the-fold\r\n* Download statistics (php-ga?)\r\n* Export download stats as raw data\r\n* Search system\r\n  * (searching Kethane should show Kethane first, not HexCans with Kethane models, etc)\r\n* No moderation queue for new uploads, at least for trusted users\r\n* Versioning - Keep old versions, remember what version they were for, etc\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nMod meta data:\r\nMod Name\r\nAuthor Name\r\nWebsite URL\r\nAuthor URL\r\nKSP Version\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nScreenshots and/or Videos. Slider/Gallery? Lightbox? Must not push download button off screen.\r\n\r\nChangelogs, based on versioning\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n\r\nLink to source\r\nLink to donate\r\nLink to forum thread\r\n\r\nNo commenting, or option to Disable commenting per-mod.\r\n\r\nMod review system? Thumbs up or down, like Steam, replacing comments. Will require flagging reviews as \"incompatible\" or \"Incorrect install\" to get rid of the \"IT DOESNT WORK FOR ME\"\r\n\r\nUpvote only rating system, reputation system, decay?\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nOff-site downloads, but still tracking clicks. Consider that those mods may become 404, require captchas, or otherwise offer poor UX to our users.\r\n\r\nSubscription to mod updates. RSS feeds. Push notifications? (There must be a third party service for all of these. Mailchimp integration?)\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nDo not force quality. Do not force semantics. Do not force required file structures.\r\n\r\nAllow different licenses. Possibly require users to click \"accept\" to donwload, as a mod-specific setting? (I'm not a lawyer)\r\n\r\nFlag for spam, offensive, etc. Moderation thing.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nGood example of a similar repository, for reference:\r\nhttps://www.npmjs.org/package/underscore\r\n\r\nMulti-categorization\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nPossibly separate craft file upload, with mod dependencies\r\n\r\nCategories and tags. Possibly \"primary\" categories which are limited, which your mod \r\n\r\nis mostly composed of.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nWorks with vX.XX to confirm if your mod works with what version\r\n\r\nList mod dependencies\r\n\r\nRead this at some point:\r\nhttp://blogs.msdn.com/b/ericgu/archive/2004/01/12/57985.aspx\r\n\r\nRESTful API like this:\r\nhttp://radleygh.com/images/notepad_2014-128-01-22-39-31.png","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
