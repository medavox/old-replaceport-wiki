Or if you know of a better place to host this info, feel free to do so. Ask me and I can provide you with the Markdown or HTML source (tables are annoying to copy).\r\n\r\n##The Story So Far\r\n\r\nOK, so Majiir noticed a while back that Kerbal Space Port was getting increasingly inadequate for the modding community's needs, so he announced a Challenge for someone to develop a new replacement, which he had the resources to sufficiently host.\r\n\r\nWhat with the recent announcement that [Curse are taking over mod management](http://kerbaldevteam.tumblr.com/post/84927345579/kerbal-space-program-curse-com-partner-together-for) and [Kerbal Space Port](http://kerbalspaceport.com/) is being closed on the 30th May, interest has spiked in building a new mod hosting platform.\r\n\r\nCurrently, various parallel efforts are being made to build a site, which you can read about on the aforementioned [forum thread](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/71133-Community-Mod-Repository-and-The-Majiir-Challenge), and on the section titled Known Projects Being Worked On, further down.\r\n\r\n[\"What we lack is a cohesive set of core features. In other words, we haven't yet (in my opinion) established a good starting point. \"](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/71133-Community-Mod-Repository-and-The-Majiir-Challenge?p=1001647&viewfull=1#post1001647) - Majiir\r\n\r\nLet's change that. Let's build a development roadmap, shall we?\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nI'll make this page editable to interested parties, but in the meantime here's what I've gleaned from the thread.\r\n\r\n\r\n##People Who Have Offered to Help\r\n\r\nName | Type of help | Contact details (permission needed)\r\n-----|--------------|------------------------------------\r\nMajiir | Hosting | See first forum post\r\nFEinchinger | creating a site | ''\r\ncroxis | creating a site | ''\r\nrappelle | creating a site, needs crowdsourced design docs | \r\nZeroIgnite | also writing this guide | \r\n[medavox]| made this guide :) | [forum account](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/members/74223-medavox)\r\npsyper | [\"I can't see anything here which is outside of my skills set\"](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/71133-Community-Mod-Repository-and-The-Majiir-Challenge?p=1000827&viewfull=1#post1000827) |\r\njohnley | [\"I would love to help with this project\"](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/71133-Community-Mod-Repository-and-The-Majiir-Challenge?p=1005649&viewfull=1#post1005649) | see quote link\r\n\r\n##Resources & Links\r\n* [Forum thread](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/71133-Community-Mod-Repository-and-The-Majiir-Challenge)\r\n* [Design Document](https://onedrive.live.com/view.aspx?resid=131B3D0DB2B5645E!13895&ithint=file%2c.docx&app=Word&authkey=!AI8mdtoB8fHqr8s) made in March by TrueBorn\r\n* [Majiir's Preferences](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/71133-Community-Mod-Repository-and-The-Majiir-Challenge?p=1004462&viewfull=1#post1004462) on technologies used in the server. As he says, **opinion, not fact**, but a good starting point for least resistance.\r\n* [Minus 100 points](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ericgu/archive/2004/01/12/57985.aspx), by Eric Gunnerson. A short article on \"additive development\", or creating from scratch (rather than comparing to an existing system, and bringing all its baggage into the new development process)\r\n\r\n##Known Projects Being Worked On\r\nProject Name/Link | Author(s) | language(s)/platform\r\n------------------|-----------|---------------------\r\n[Kerbal Mod Repository](https://github.com/croxis/kmr) | croxis | Python and [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)\r\n[Kerbal Space Station](http://www.kerbalstation.org/)([Source on GitHub](https://github.com/kerbalspaceprogram)) | originally by [krainboltgreene] (http://www.reddit.com/user/krainboltgreene), who is \"[willing to help transition anyone with the code](http://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/24yufz/a_bit_ago_i_built_kerbal_space_station_a_quick/)\" | Ruby on Rails \r\n\r\n## Brainstorming Notes Poached From RadGH\r\n\r\n* Prominent Download link, above-the-fold\r\n* Download statistics (php-ga?)\r\n* Export download stats as raw data\r\n* Search system\r\n  * (searching Kethane should show Kethane first, not HexCans with Kethane models, etc)\r\n* No moderation queue for new uploads, at least for trusted users\r\n* Versioning - Keep old versions, remember what version they were for, etc\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n###Mod meta data:\r\n* Mod Name\r\n* Author Name\r\n* Website URL\r\n* Author URL\r\n* KSP Version\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nScreenshots and/or Videos. Slider/Gallery? Lightbox? Must not push download button off screen.\r\n\r\nChangelogs, based on versioning\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n\r\nLink to source\r\nLink to donate\r\nLink to forum thread\r\n\r\nNo commenting, or option to Disable commenting per-mod.\r\n\r\nMod review system? Thumbs up or down, like Steam, replacing comments. Will require flagging reviews as \"incompatible\" or \"Incorrect install\" to get rid of the \"IT DOESNT WORK FOR ME\"\r\n\r\nUpvote only rating system, reputation system, decay?\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nOff-site downloads, but still tracking clicks. Consider that those mods may become 404, require captchas, or otherwise offer poor UX to our users.\r\n\r\nSubscription to mod updates. RSS feeds. Push notifications? (There must be a third party service for all of these. Mailchimp integration?)\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n* Do not force quality. Do not force semantics. Do not force required file structures.\r\n* Allow different licenses. Possibly require users to click \"accept\" to donwload, as a mod-specific setting? (I'm not a lawyer)\r\n* Flag for spam, offensive, etc. Moderation thing.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nGood example of a similar repository, for reference: https://www.npmjs.org/package/underscore\r\n\r\nMulti-categorization\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n* Possibly separate craft file upload, with mod dependencies\r\n* Categories and tags. Possibly \"primary\" categories which are limited, which your mod is mostly composed of.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n* \"Works with vX.XX\" to confirm if your mod works with what version\r\n* List mod dependencies\r\n\r\nRESTful API like this:\r\nhttp://radleygh.com/images/notepad_2014-128-01-22-39-31.png","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
